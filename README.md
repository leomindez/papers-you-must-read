# Papers-You-Must-Read

Watching a video from a talk by Norberto Ortigoza [Cómo no creer en la magia - Norberto Ortigoza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-gvJgjgfeA&list=PLnLzwYW6HOC6OSE6CpMAf_VoqTdl_ovP3&index=4)
I had an idea to create a collaboratived repository to put all the papers that we think we must read about computer science. Working together to improve computer science understanding.

1. [An Axiomatic basis for Computer Science by Hoare](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare69.pdf) 
2. [On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules by D.L. Parnas](https://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf)
